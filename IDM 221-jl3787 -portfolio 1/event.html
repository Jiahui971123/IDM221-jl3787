                My senior project focuses on making a business plan to increase brand awareness for a new start-up
                clothing brand – <em>Septup</em> – through utilising the trendy tool of social media. The aim is to
                achieve the intended level of sales of 600 pieces in the timeframe of one month. The target customer
                segment of the age between 20 to 40 years old. Specifically, promotion of the brand clothing style based
                on comfortable business casual wear with a focused segment of women. This report will demonstrate the
                comprehension and application of academic knowledge acquired from the previous three years of study in
                combination with conveying the benefits and lessons learnt from undergoing this project. Lastly, how
                this project experience would assist and prepare me for my future career.

                There are numerous ways to do online promotion for a clothing brand. However, due to the limited budget
                and the pandemic crisis we decided to do a live streaming event on the platform—Taobao – to promote the
                brand. The project demonstrated the application of the knowledge I learnt over the past three years as
                it assisted me to carry out the series of activities for successfully implementing the online event. An
                example of the application is designing the trailer posters for the live streaming event. In the process
                of designing, I utilised ranges of software such as PS, AI and the operation of this software is
                something I have learned from the courses I took before. Thus, the content learnt from the courses was
                very practical in helping me to prepare the fundamental parts of advertisement and marketing without the
                need to go and search for individuals who are expert in this field.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is more of the comprehension of the content is the importance of selling point when marketing a
                product. The initial plan of the project tailoring the product to customers such as mother and daughters
                to be sold on Mother’s Day. Yet, the date chosen did not match with the date given by the manager of the
                live stream platform. Consequently, we switched and adapted to a new immediate plan of focusing on
                comfortable business wear for women at work. This illustrated the essentiality of the flexibility of the
                team and plan when encountering unpredictable circumstances. Hence, the appreciation to possess an agile
                plan for the designed product is essential for the ultimate success as projects can only be brought
                forward without fixated on the initial desired plan. Furthermore, the change in date meant that the live
                streaming event time posted on the preview poster on social media needs to be changed. This meant that I
                had to change it smoothly in a short period as well as explain to those people who have subscribed to
                watch the event. Moreover, in this project, I learned how to utilize hot news as promotion materials to
                help the niche brand improve its popularity and attractiveness. For example, in the initial promotion
                content, I only made a trailer poster to post on several the brand’s official social media accounts
                including Weibo and Xiaohongshu. However, at the time of that we need to reschedule time for the event
                and repost new version of promotion content to let audience to know this updating information, the news
                about Xinjiang cotton banning became a headline. I think it is good opportunity to use this headline as
                our promotion materials because some parts of clothing the brand were made by Xinjiang cotton and I also
                want to use this opportunity to show audience that we keep supporting Made in China as a Chinese
                clothing brand. As expected, the new version of promotion content posted on the brand’s official social
                media accounts got lots of attention. Many people leave many comments below it and they said that they
                look forward to the brand’s the first live streaming shopping event. Through undertaking the promotion
                and branding module in the previous years of study, I applied the knowledge from the course to better
                restructure and reorganize the language of the announcement released on social media.

                When pursuing the project, I faced the uncontrollable challenge of internet problems during the live
                streaming event. The application of basic operation knowledge of equipment such as the light sets,
                placement of the camera, all was gained from the photography and shooting course I took at Drexel
                before. Even with these pieces of knowledge gained, I faced the challenge of internet instability which
                was a factor that I was unable to control. Due to the unstable Wi-Fi connection, the live streaming
                event automatically quit for a few minutes, which brought inconvenience to the audience and minor
                disruption to the entire event. Yet, I dealt with it calmly and successfully through delegating the
                roles, which demonstrated my strength of leadership. The assistant immediately contacted relevant
                backstage technicians and find out how to restore the live-streaming as soon as possible. My job was to
                explain the situation to the audience charmingly through the chat room in order to minimize the concerns
                and negativity. In addition, we clarified the clothing again in the live streaming to ensure that every
                product was well-explained and marketed to the intended audiences. Although, the first run through test
                went well and we had prepared thoroughly the probability of an issue appearing still exist. Therefore,
                in my future career, I should continue with my calm behaviour when encountered a problem in order to
                solve it effectively and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                As discussed previously, the change of the live stream date was a challenge for me because of the need
                to not only redesign and communicate the adjustment, but also the need to change the entire design theme
                due to this issue because it is no longer Mother's Day theme orientated. Subsequently, I faced the
                challenge of design in terms of communication with the factory collaborated. The alteration of design
                from material to decoration cost us a lot of time which caused delays. From this aspect, I reflected
                that in the future, I should confirm the main process before moving towards other steps as one change in
                the central stage would cause delay for the entire process. Therefore, the experience from this project
                was valuable for my future career as I recognise the importance of making sure the accuracy of each
                stage ensure efficiency. Besides, the first promotion text of the live stream event posted on social
                media had little effect to increase publicity and awareness of the stream. I dealt with it by changing
                the trailer using the knowledge learnt from the course which obtained favourable results. More people
                left messages and commented on the post after the change. Nevertheless, with all the challenges faced
                during the project and few operational glitches during the event, the result was uplifting. As a result
                of the live stream, more than 1,000 people watched the show, which was better than expected.

                Technology plays a significant role in all our lives with live streaming becoming ever-trendier. Whether
                large or small enterprises are interested and will definitely utilise live streaming to promote their
                products and improve their services. Social media platforms are a unique medium for all to reach their
                target audience. The opportunity of undergoing this project focusing on marketing through live streaming
                is undoubtedly beneficial for my future career. From the perspective that, I learnt to function the
                popular medium which allowed video monetization in the special circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic
                together with the cost-effective way when we are under tight financial budget.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experience of planning and pursuing the live stream event equipped me with a new set of skills,
                which are very relevant for the preparation of my future career. As the contemporary world is becoming
                ever more internet-connected, with the majority of the population that are reliant on their mobile
                technology. The experience of the live stream and the detailed knowledge of working with different
                stakeholders such as designers and factory owners gave me the opportunity to enhance my interpersonal
                skills of communication and negotiation. I can better utilise the new function of social media and
                related medium to promote products for the company. Moreover, the live interactive experience tested my
                attitude and behaviour when faced with unpredicted issues, where I discovered my capability to adjust
                effectively in changing circumstances. Additionally, I gained knowledge from another field such as the
                textile industry. Where I expanded my horizon in terms of choosing fabrics, communicate the details with
                the factory owner which will be practical for preparing for my future career.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the fact that we did not achieve the intended sales level of 600 pieces of clothing for the
                reason that the factory did not deliver several pieces of clothes on time. This meant that the models
                were not able to try them on to display them to the audiences on the day of the live streaming event. As
                a result, I reflected that the main reason for this issue resulted from the time wasted in the
                communication with the factory concerning the detailed improvement of clothes. Therefore, in the future
                career when preparing for anything, I need to make sure all the tiny processes are followed and ensured
                to prevent any barriers that may alter the intended result. Overall, pursuing this project was fruitful
                concluded from the aspect of act as a tool to reach a wider customer community and have equipped me with
                the knowledge and skills preparing me for my future career. Also, I think this project can be a case or
                working experience on my resume.
