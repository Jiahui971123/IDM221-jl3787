            <h2>Job Experience</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the process of my internship â€“ marketing assistant, I have gained a lot. I will introduce some
                important experiences in detail: First, clarify the purpose of the investigation; The purpose of the
                market investigation is to provide decision-makers with decision-making basis. The department that uses
                the market research can be a group of people or individual in a company. Also, a marketing survey can
                help a company to create a long-term strategic plan, or provide a basis for developing a specific policy
                or strategy for a certain stage or for a problem. It can be academic or practical. Therefore, in the
                early stage of our investigation, we must clarify the purpose of the investigation. Due to our team
                neglecting this point, as we met in the initial stage of discussion, there were many differences, which
                led to waste some time. But, under the guidance of the employer, we clarified the purpose of the survey
                and through the survey of current college students' views on movies, we understanding the needs of users
                and satisfaction, analyzing the market conditions and limitations of the film in college students, and
                proposing and designing effective Local marketing campaigns to help the film get a higher box office.

                Second, I remembered that in a monthly conference, I did a report with some inaccurate data. My employer
                gave me some feedback and advices which make me to have a good experience. I realized that I need to
                summarized my every assignment no matter how successful is. Working process need to be clear and pay
                more attention on details in my work. During my free time, I need to be more familiar with my own
                business and go to the large market research. Moreover, strengthen service awareness in my position. To
                be honest, those people I meet in process give the most help tome being responsibility, hardworking and
                being open mind in study. They affect both my work and usual life time. Assistant is an attentive job,
                which I put into all my occupation and emotion. When generally receive successful, the first I care is
                about the progress.

                In the future, I hope that I can have a strong perception and think more creative ideas. During these
                three months, I have been adapted to my work environment through continuous learning and self
                -improvement. Although I find it difficult to fully integrate into every aspect initially. Maybe
                considered in some of the issues is not comprehensive, but through employer and colleagues of guidance
                and help, I was better in the future work to improve our apartment business level and overall quality.
                Better to complete my assignments and constantly seek a sustainable development trend.
