        <h2>Senior Project</h2>
        <p>My senior project focuses on making a business plan to increase brand awareness for a start-up clothing brand – Septup – through utilizing the trendy tool of social media. 
          Fashion design industry has formed a highly competitive market. Many fashion brands cannot be exposed to a wider audience. Especially like Septup, an emerging fashion brand. 
          For helping the brand increasing the its recognition and boost sales, I designed a promotion project for the brand’s SS/2021 collection. 
          Due to the pandemic and limited promotion budget, I made a low-cost online promotion like livestream shopping event in a Chinese ecommerce platform, Taobao. 
          The aim is to achieve the intended level of sales of 600 pieces in the timeframe of one month. The target customer segment of the age between 20 to 40 years old.
          Specifically, promotion of the brand clothing style based on comfortable business casual wear with a focused segment of women. 
          Here is a video about my working cut during this online event, which is shown below.</p>
