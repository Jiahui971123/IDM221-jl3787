            <h2>About me</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Seriously, who’s Li Jia hui?</h3>
            <p>
                I’m now a senior at Drexel University, and I will embrace my last term on campus. In the past four
                years, I’ve greatly improved my English skills. Therefore, I dare to say that I can speak fluently in
                English, Chinese, and Cantonese. I really appreciate the time I spent in Drexel. Also, I got to know
                many professional background knowledges of various fields. As for my major? I study Entertainment and
                Art Management at Drexel, and I mainly concentrate on digital media.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Jiahui in America.</h3>
            <p>
                Being an international student at Drexel, I’ve experienced different teaching and learning cultures in
                China. This difference helps me grow into a person with inclusiveness and a great understanding of
                various unusual phenomena. Moreover, I learned how to live independently and arrange my life, and study
                very well. The most wonderful thing for me is that I’ve made friends worldwide and known different
                cultures and traditions. Life in Drexel is like living in a magical world. It seems that amazing
                acquaintances happen every day. Through communication, cooperation, and learning, I’ve built up mature
                outlooks of life and value. I believe this can benefit my future career path for a lifetime.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why Jiahui in America?</h3>
            <p>
                You may wonder why Jiahui traveled all the way from China to study in the U.S.A. I have to say that I’m
                very decisive about what I’m going to do in the future. I’m quite sure that my future career plan is
                associated with the management and operation of media. Therefore, I focused on photography skills and
                used photo editing tools and others to publish a magazine in my senior high school. Since establishing a
                magazine club with my friends in senior high, I’ve realized my love and passion for photography. As time
                went by, I decided to study social media to improve myself. That’s why I’m here. A girl dares to dream
                and dares to make it happen.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>A true Jiahui.</h3>
            <p>
                Now that you’ve read all the above, I have faith that my qualities of being optimistic, critical,
                rigorous, and down-to-earth have been shown. Also, after the internship as a market assistant at a China
                new media company, I became sensitive towards data and enabled adaptability and data analysis.
